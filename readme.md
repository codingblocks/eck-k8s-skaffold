# Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes

Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes ([ECK](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-cloud-kubernetes)) provides everything you need to run Elasticsearch in Kubernetes. In this presentation I'll show you how you can use it to set up environments including...

* Automatically loading sample data
* Rolling upgrades
* Modular deployments

By the end of this presentation, you will be creating your own Elastic Stack architectures for development, testing, experimentation, and fun!
