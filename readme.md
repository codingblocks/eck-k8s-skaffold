# Easy Local Development with Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes with Skaffold

Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) provides everything you need to run the Elasticsearch and Kibana in Kubernetes. We will use ECK together with Skaffold, an open-source Kubernetes tool from Google, to create a simple, flexible, and modular environment that is easy to develop for.

By the end of this presentation, you will be creating your own Elastic Stack architectures for development, testing, experimentation, and fun. Yes, really!

## Requirements

- Skaffold
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Helm
