# Title
In this presentation we are going to build a local development environment for the Elastic Stack that will be easy to work with in Kubernetes.

- Why you should consider running Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK)
- Reasons you may not want to run ECK
- Show you how to get a solid foundation

The code for this up on Github, there is a link in the description. Of course, I tried to make it as easy as possible to get started. I tried to be really careful when I did this, because sometimes presentations or videos or blogs will boil something down to a really simple prototype. As soon as you try to make any changes, the whole thing falls apart because the prototype was designed to be demonstratable, not for production.

I want this demonstration to be different. I want to give you something you can take and make your own. In fact we'll be creating and evolving several different envronments throughout this talk.

# About Coding Blocks
I have a podcast with a couple friends where we talk about all things Software Development, if you like this presentation, then you'll probably like that too.

# Why Run Elastic on Kubernetes

- You're already there!
- Benefits of Kubernetes
- Agility
- Local parity
- Experimentation (SimCity)

# Why not?

- Elastic Cloud
- Complexity
- Performance?

# Challenges
- Cattle vs pets
- Layer of indirection (operators)
- You can ruin everything very quickly
